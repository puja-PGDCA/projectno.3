<h3>Academic Structure</h3>
</summary>
At IIITG, undergraduate education emphasizes on a broad academic foundation, development of deep subject-area knowledge, a variety of rich learning experiences inside and outside the classroom, and cultivation of skills to help students become lifelong learners. With an enduring dedication to the pursuit of excellence, IIIT-G offers unparalleled student experiences across a broad spectrum of academics environment. The B.Tech courses offered at IIITG are:<br>
<h4><u>B.Tech in CSE</u></h4>
<p>The programme is designed to create innovators and researchers. Students are given a strong foundation in CSE that includes electronics and hardware. The B.Tech (CSE) program at IIIT-Guwahati starts with computing oriented courses first, and allows the possibility of doing science courses later. Besides being better suited for an IT program, it also enables the possibility of students seeing newer applications and possibilities of relating IT with these subjects.</p><b>
<h4><u>B.Tech in ECE</u></h4>
<p>The programme is designed to create innovators and researchers. ECE courses like electronics, signals & systems, communications, VLSI, and embedded systems are introduced in the early semesters. Students also take a number of CSE oriented courses: Programming, Data Structures, Operating Systems, Networks.  The main objectives of the B.Tech (ECE) program are to produce students who are well prepared for Indian industry with necessary core competency to succeed long-term in engineering/entrepreneurship careers (post B.Tech), and who are well prepared to undertake PG studies and research careers.</p><br>
The academic year has been divided into two semesters namely the MONSOON semester from July-Dec and the WINTER semester from Jan-May.<br>
The winter vacation period for students is generally in the month of December and the summer vacation period is from the beginning of May to the third week of July.<br>
