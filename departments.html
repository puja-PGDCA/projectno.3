<h1>Computer Science and Engineering</h1>
<p>The programme is designed to create innovators and researchers. Students are given a strong foundation in CSE that includes electronics and hardware. The B.Tech. (CSE) program at IIIT-Guwahati starts with computing oriented courses first, and allows the possibility of doing science courses later. Besides being better suited for an IT program, it also enables the possibility of students seeing newer applications and possibilities of relating IT with these subjects.</p><br><br>
<p><a href="">Vission & Mission</a></p><br><br>
<h1><a href="">Electronics and Communication Engineering</a></h1><br><br>
<p>The programme is designed to create innovators and researchers. ECE courses like electronics, signals & systems, communications, VLSI, and embedded systems are introduced in the early semesters. The main objectives of the B.Tech.(ECE) program are to produce students who are well prepared for Indian industry with necessary core competency to succeed long-term in engineering/entrepreneurship careers (post B.Tech.), and who are well prepared to undertake PG studies and research careers.</p><br><br>
<h1>Science and Mathmatics</h1><br><br>
<p>The Department of Science and Mathematics at IIIT Guwahati started in 2013 with the aim to groom mathematically sound young minds for problem solving in industry and other concerns. The department has been vigorously engaged in research and teaching in relevant areas of mathematics, statistics and computer science. Currently, the department offers only PhD programme and plays an important role as a supporting department to various B.Tech programmes of the institute. The department has at present 4 young, energetic, and dedicated faculty members with expertise in diverse areas of mathematics.</p><br><br>
<h1>Humanities and Social Sciences</h1>
<p>The Department of Humanities and Social Sciences of IIITG was formally established on 31 March 2016. It currently has five faculty members who teach various compulsory and elective courses at the undergraduate level in different disciplines of HSS such as English, Linguistics, Economics and Political Science. Doctoral Programme was started in 2015 and the Department currently has 4 part-time research scholars engaged in different fields. It also works in tandem with the CS and ECE Departments of the institute and engages in regular cross-disciplinary academic dialogue with them through<a href="">Perspectivecall_</a>made. The Department strives to provide crucial social orientation in technical education to students. The essentially inter-disciplinary nature of teaching ensures that students develop a deep appreciation and critical understanding of different linguistic, economic and political aspects of social life.</p>
